# Power Inspection Super-Resolution via Lightweight RWKV Framework and Specialized Dataset
## Abstract
With the continual advancement of modern power systems, there is an increasing demand for high accuracy and reliability in image processing technologies for power inspection tasks. Existing datasets, primarily focusing on natural scenes, fail to adequately address the specific requirements of power inspection. To address this gap, we introduce the Power Inspection Single Image Super-Resolution (PISR) dataset, comprising nearly 1,000 high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) image pairs tailored for power inspection scenarios. This dataset covers a wide range of electrical equipment in real inspection settings, ensuring data quality and diversity through rigorous screening and preprocessing. Furthermore, we propose a novel lightweight power inspection framework named SR-RWKV, which leverages a linear attention mechanism to mitigate the computational complexity of traditional Transformer-based models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-RWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Notably, the PISR dataset contributes to a PSNR improvement of 1.43 dB compared to the DIV2K dataset. 
## Overview
1.We propose a new dataset, the PISR dataset, specifically for the SISR task of power inspection. It is the largest and most comprehensive SR dataset in the power inspection domain, covering a wide range of real-world scenarios.   
2.We are first work to adapt RWKV architecture for SISR task. By incorporating a linear attention mechanism, the model effectively addresses the quadratic complexity issue commonly associated with Transformer-based SR models, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction performance.   
3.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method outperforms other strong baselines, providing a powerful backbone solution for power inspection SISR task.

### SR-RWKV
SR-RWKV is a lightweight network with a linear attention mechanism which eliminates the quadratic complexity of the Transformer. It consists of three main stages: the shallow feature extraction stage ,the deep feature extraction stage and the high-resolution image reconstruction stage.
Deep feature extraction stage stacks multiple Residual R-RWKV Groups and serves as the core of the network. RRRGs consist of multiple R-RWKV to efficiently capture global dependencies with linear computational complexity. SR-RWKV utilizes a Recurrent WKV attention mechanism to simulate 2D dependencies in different scanning directions. Additionally, A convolutional layer is added at the end of the block for feature enhancement and residual connection for feature aggregation.
